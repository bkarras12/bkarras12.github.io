    <div class="article-title">Modern Dating in Numbers</div>

        <p>
            The landscape of love and dating has undergone a seismic shift in the 21st century, propelled by the advent of digital technology. 
            Gone are the days when romantic connections were predominantly forged in school hallways, through mutual friends, or within community 
            gatherings. Today, the quest for companionship often begins with a swipe, a like, or a message on an online platform. This article delves 
            into the statistics that paint a picture of modern dating, revealing how technology intertwines with the human desire for connection.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the past decade, online dating has transitioned from a fringe activity to a fundamental aspect of the romantic lives of millions. Approximately 30% of U.S. 
            adults have used a dating site or app, with figures rising among younger demographics and the LGBTQ+ community. 
            Couples who meet online are more likely to progress to marriage compared to those who meet through traditional means. 
            Studies suggest that relationships started online are less likely to end in the first year.

            While digital platforms offer unprecedented access to potential partners, many express feelings of overwhelm and frustration. 
            Users often cite challenges such as superficiality, ghosting, and the paradox of choice, which has lead to a decrease in young adults being
            involved in a romantic experience. Safety remains a paramount concern as well, with daters being wary of scams, misleading profiles, 
            and privacy breaches. Despite these concerns, the majority view online dating as a necessary tool in the modern quest for love.
        </p>

            The statistics of modern dating reveal a complex portrait of how individuals are navigating the realms of love, intimacy, and 
            connection in the digital age. As technology continues to evolve, so too will the ways in which we seek out and establish romantic
             relationships. Amidst the numbers and trends, the enduring quest for love remains a testament to the human condition, ever-adapting
              to the changing tides of society and technology.
